# UFOs

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to create a webpage that allows us to filter the table containing UFO sightings.
Multiple filters on the webiste are Date, City, State, Country and shape which can be used at the same time.

## Results

1. When you open the webpage, you get a defualt table containing all the sightings, which is quite a lot is you want to find a specific sighting.

2. You see the filter serach section on the left side of the webpage.
Enter a value in any of the feilds provided (Here we input ca in state).

5. You can repeat the process to arrive at the sighting you want to review

## Summary

### Drawbacks

1. The webpage does not indicate when a wrong input is provided.(Case - sensitive)
2. If there is no data matching the search filters it should show no results found.

### Recommendations

1. We can add a grouping function to calculate the total sighting for a particular date or city/state or shape to better understand the pattern of sightings.
2. We can add a check which would display no results found if the filters do not match any data.
3. We can connect the data to a updated datasource to provide recent results as well.
